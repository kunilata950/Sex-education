<h1>Understanding Sex</h1>

<p>
Sex is a natural part of human life involving physical intimacy,
emotional connection, and reproduction. It is influenced by biology,
culture, personal values, and communication.

Healthy understanding of sex starts with education, respect for oneself,
and respect for others. It is not just about physical actions, but also
about trust, safety, and responsibility.
