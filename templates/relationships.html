<h1>Relationships and Intimacy</h1>

<p>
Sex within relationships is closely connected to emotional intimacy,
trust, and communication.
</p>

<p>
Healthy relationships are based on mutual respect, honesty,
and understanding boundaries.
</p>

<p>
Physical intimacy should strengthen connection, not create fear or control.
