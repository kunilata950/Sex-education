<h1>Consent</h1>

<p>
Consent means freely agreeing to participate in any sexual activity.
It must be clear, enthusiastic, and ongoing.
</p>

<p>
Silence, pressure, or fear do not equal consent. Anyone can change
their mind at any time, and that decision must be respected.
</p>

<p>
Consent is about communication, not assumptions.
